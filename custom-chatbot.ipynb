The third is the medium, which is what the media is. There are 7 different mediums of entertainment, and lastly setting has 6 different settings.\n",

This is mostly pretaining to building out a knowledge management with a question and ansewring component. This datset features columns that are quite useful for future use cases such as name, descriptions, location, and classification tags.\n",

I will offer my AI services to a possible company that maintains character databases to create entertainment such as Fox, Netflix, and other major companies that want to offer their knowledge management tool. Additionally, this can be used to build our their own Wiki sources, since it is becoming popular to ask questions on characters once you finish watching a movie or reading a book to get every detail on a character."
